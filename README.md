# Signal_Proccessing

## This repository contains my audio signal processing notebooks as part of my personal self-study plan. 

### Current notebooks:
1. Amplitude Envelop: Analyzes the overall shape and dynamics of an audio signal
2. RMSEnergy: Measures the loudness or energy of audio segments or frames
3. Zero-Crossing rate: Distinguishes between noisy and non-noisy segments in audio signals or detects rapid transitions in audio.
